# **AWS Project Thread 6: Military Family Coordination & Security Platform**  

## **üìú Background**  

Military families often experience **frequent relocations, long deployments, and the need for secure communication and document management**. Most commercial platforms‚Äîsuch as **Google Drive, iCloud, Life360, and LastPass**‚Äîrely on cloud services that **store personal data externally, track user activity, and require internet access**, making them **unreliable or insecure for military personnel and their families**.  

To address these concerns, the **Unified Cyber Defense (UCD) task force** has commissioned **Cyber Sentinel Solutions (CSS)** to develop a **self-hosted, privacy-focused family coordination platform**. This system will provide **secure document collaboration, real-time location tracking, digital security management, and a unified dashboard**‚Äîall without reliance on big tech. **Families, deployed personnel, and off-grid teams** will have complete control over their data, ensuring **mission security, personal privacy, and operational continuity**.  

This solution will be deployed across **AWS and GCP**, using **K3s for lightweight container orchestration**, fully automated with **Ansible**, and integrated with **self-hosted security and family management tools** to create a **resilient, independent, and secure digital ecosystem**.

## **üìå Military & Family Coordination Use Cases**  
- Provides **self-hosted, private alternatives** to Google Drive, iCloud, OneDrive, Life360, and LastPass.  
- Enables **secure family document collaboration and data sharing** without reliance on big tech.  
- Ensures **family members can share locations & send emergency alerts** when traveling or deployed.  
- Offers **self-hosted digital security tools** for **password management, identity protection, and secure file storage**.  
- Supports **off-grid, remote, and operational security-conscious individuals** with **full control over personal data**.  

---

## **‚öôÔ∏è Technical Focus**  
- **Kubernetes Management Tool** provides **cluster monitoring, service orchestration, and deployment control**.  
- **LibreOffice Online (Collabora)** serves as a **self-hosted office suite for document creation, spreadsheets, and presentations**.  
- **OwnTracks** provides **self-hosted, privacy-first real-time family location tracking & emergency check-ins**.  
- **Bitwarden** offers **self-hosted password management & secure credential sharing**.  
- **Nextcloud** enables **family document storage, calendar, and secure data sharing**.  
- **Ferdium** integrates all services into a **single, unified dashboard**.  
- **K3s-based Kubernetes cluster** deployed across **AWS and GCP** for redundancy.  
- **Ansible automation** for **streamlined installation and configuration**.  
- **AWS services** such as **S3 for encrypted storage, Cognito for identity management, and CloudWatch for security monitoring** can be integrated to enhance functionality.

## **üìå Project Requirements**  

### ‚úÖ **Deploy 4-5 Virtual Machines** *(via AWS & GCP GUI)*  
- **3 in AWS** (EC2 instances)  
- **1-2 in GCP** (Compute Engine VMs)  

### ‚úÖ **Use Ansible to Automate**  
- **Install K3s & Docker** on all nodes.  
- **Deploy Kubernetes management tool** *(Rancher, Portainer, or Lens - deployed via Ansible in a standalone Docker container.)*  
- **Deploy all self-hosted family security & coordination tools in K3s**.  

### ‚úÖ **Deploy & Expose the Following Services** *(Accessible via Browser & Mobile Apps)*  
- **Kubernetes Management Tool** *(Rancher, Portainer, or Lens - deployed via Ansible in a standalone Docker container.)*  
- **LibreOffice Online (Collabora)** *(Self-hosted office suite for document creation, editing, and collaboration.)*  
- **OwnTracks** *(Self-hosted location tracking & real-time family check-ins.)*  
- **Bitwarden** *(Self-hosted password manager for secure credential sharing.)*  
- **Nextcloud** *(Self-hosted family document storage, calendar, and file sharing.)*  
- **Ferdium** *(Unified dashboard for managing family security & coordination tools.)*  

### ‚úÖ **Integrate AWS Services (Total: 5)**  
- **Mandatory AWS Services:**  
  - **EC2** ‚Äì Hosts the family coordination & security platform.  
  - **S3** ‚Äì Stores encrypted family documents, location logs, and chat backups.  

- **Select 3 additional AWS services to enhance your project. Below are 5 recommended options:**  
  - **AWS Cognito** ‚Äì Provides secure authentication & identity management for family members.  
  - **AWS CloudWatch** ‚Äì Monitors system uptime and alerts for security threats.  
  - **AWS Lambda** ‚Äì Automates alerts for family location tracking and secure backup tasks.  
  - **AWS DynamoDB (Optional)** ‚Äì Stores real-time location tracking logs in a NoSQL database.  
  - **AWS Secrets Manager** ‚Äì Securely stores passwords, API keys, and encryption keys.  

---

### ‚úÖ **Upload & Access Demo Content**  
- **Record a project demo/video** and upload to an **S3 bucket**.  
- **Ensure all family security & coordination services are accessible via browser and mobile apps.**  

### ‚úÖ *(Optional)* Secure Remote Access with Twingate or Tailscale  
- **If required, implement Twingate for secure external access to self-hosted services.**  

---

## **üõ† Role of Each Tool**  

### **AWS Services**  
- **EC2** ‚Äì Hosts 3 virtual machines for the family coordination & security platform.  
- **S3** ‚Äì Stores encrypted backups, chat logs, and family files.  
- **Cognito (Optional)** ‚Äì **Provides secure family login & authentication**.  
- **CloudWatch (Optional)** ‚Äì **Monitors system uptime & alerts family members to outages**.  
- **Lambda (Optional)** ‚Äì **Automates security & tracking alerts**.  
- **DynamoDB (Optional)** ‚Äì **Stores real-time location tracking data**.  
- **Secrets Manager (Optional)** ‚Äì **Stores passwords & encryption keys securely**.  

---

### **Ansible**  
- **Install K3s** on all nodes.  
- **Install Docker** on the machine hosting the Kubernetes management tool.  
- **Deploy Kubernetes management tool** *(Rancher, Portainer, or Lens in a standalone Docker container.)*  
- **Deploy all family coordination & security services** *(LibreOffice Online, OwnTracks, Bitwarden, Nextcloud, Ferdium) in Kubernetes.*
