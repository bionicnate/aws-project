# **AWS Project: Self-Hosted Solutions for Military & Technical Applications**  

## **üìú Introduction**  

This repository contains a series of **AWS-based self-hosted projects** designed to **develop technical expertise in cloud infrastructure, Kubernetes, and DevOps automation**. Each project is structured around **real-world military and technical use cases**, integrating **self-hosted applications, containerized services, and infrastructure automation** using **AWS, GCP, Kubernetes (K3s), and Ansible**.  

The goal of these projects is to **provide hands-on experience in deploying and managing cloud-native applications** while ensuring **privacy, security, and operational independence**. Students will gain experience with:  

- **Cloud Computing** ‚Äì Deploying virtual machines across AWS & GCP.  
- **Kubernetes** ‚Äì Running lightweight, scalable containerized workloads.  
- **Infrastructure as Code** ‚Äì Automating deployments using Ansible.  
- **DevOps & Security Tools** ‚Äì Managing self-hosted applications for networking, security, and collaboration.  
- **AWS Services Integration** ‚Äì Leveraging AWS tools for authentication, monitoring, and automation.  

Each project includes a **realistic military or technical scenario**, requiring students to build, deploy, and manage a **fully functional, self-hosted platform** while integrating **essential AWS services**.

## **üìå Presentation vs. Demo Recording**  

Students are required to complete **two key deliverables** for each project:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Project Presentation:**  
- A **technical overview** of the project infrastructure.  
- Explanation of **how Ansible playbooks work**, what they configure, and why they are structured that way.  
- A **deep dive into Kubernetes deployments**, services, and architecture.  
- **Challenges faced and solutions implemented** during deployment.  
- **Integration of AWS services** and how they enhance the platform.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Demo Recording (Uploaded to S3):**  
- A **practical demonstration** of the **platform in action**.  
- Walkthrough of **how users interact with the deployed services**.  
- **Showcasing functionality** (e.g., logging in, using applications, testing features).  
- Ensuring **everything works as expected** from an **end-user perspective**.  

The **presentation focuses on infrastructure, automation, and implementation**, while the **demo recording showcases the final product from a user‚Äôs perspective**. Both are **essential components** of the learning experience and must be **properly structured and documented**.
